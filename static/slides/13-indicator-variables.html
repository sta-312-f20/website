## Variable types

* So far, our models have only included _numeric_ (_quantitative_) variables
--

  * What would the equation be for predicting `\(y\)` from `\(x\)` when `\(x\)` is numeric?
--

* What would happen if `\(x\)` is categorical?
--

  * What would the equation be for predicting `\(y\)` from `\(x\)` if `\(x\)` is categorical with 2 levels?
--

  * What would the equation be for predicting `\(y\)` from `\(x\)` if `\(x\)` is categorical with 3 levels?

## indicator variable

An **indicator variable** uses two values, usually 0 and 1, to indicate whether a data case does (1) or does not (0) belong to a specific category

--
* What if we wanted a different referent category?

--
  * We could code the indicators ourselves
  
--
  * We can change the level with the `levels()` function

Input the **design matrix**, `\(\mathbf{X}\)` from the following data in R

y | age
---|----
2 | "&lt;20"
3 | "20-50"
5 | "&gt;50"
10 | "&lt;20"
1 | "20-50"
3 | "&gt;50"

Estimate the `\(\beta\)` coefficients for predicting y from age.
