In the [Derive the Hat Matrix](https://youtu.be/97aL2LkxE3c) video, I derive the hat matrix. I skip a few steps when taking the derivative of $(y-\mathbf{X}\beta)^T(y-\mathbf{X}\beta)$. Fill in these steps and derive the hat matrix here (using $\LaTeX$). Don't remember all of the $\LaTeX$ symbols? Here is a [cheat sheet](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/244/2015/04/LaTeX-Syntax-Cheat-Sheet.pdf).

Start with the sum of squared residuals:

$$\sum\epsilon^2 = \epsilon^T\epsilon = (y-\mathbf{X}\beta)^T(y-\mathbf{X}\beta)$$

1. Open Rstudio Server Pro
2. Create a new project (call it something sensible, perhaps `02-appex-hat-matrix`)
3. Click File > New File > R Markdown
4. Delete everything except for 
```

5. Give your work a sensible title
6. After adding your derivation to the file (remember you can incorporate $\LaTeX$ by wrapping in `$$`), knit it.
6. When you've finished, upload the .html file to Canvas
