Input the **design matrix**, $\mathbf{X}$ from the following data in R

y | age
---|----
2 | "<20"
3 | "20-50"
5 | ">50"
10 | "<20"
1 | "20-50"
3 | ">50"

Estimate the $\beta$ coefficients for predicting y from age.

We are interested in predicting a chicken's weight based on their diet using the `chickwts` dataset

* Fit the model of interest and extract the estimated $\beta$ coefficients
* Construct $\mathbf{x}_0$ for a chicken that is eating "sunflower". 
* Find the predicted weight for a chicken eating sunflowers.

Show that the variance of $\mathbf{x}_0^T\hat\beta$ is 

$$\textrm{var}(\mathbf{x}_0^T\hat\beta) = \mathbf{x}_0^T(\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{x}_0\sigma^2$$

* What is the expected value of $\mathbf{x}_0^T\beta + \epsilon$?
* Show that the variance is 

$$(1 + \mathbf{x}_0^T(\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{x}_0)\sigma^2$$
